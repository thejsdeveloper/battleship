# Battleship â›´

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which
each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are
concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's
ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship
occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The
number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship. The ships cannot overlap
After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each
player takes a turn to target a square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at.

The game is playable by two players on the same device, using a
turn-based strategy where the first player indicates that they have completed the
turn. They are then able to pass the device to the other player whereby they
specify that they are going to take their turn. Once the second player has taken
the turn they will specify that the turn is complete and pass the device back to the
original player.

Before the game begins both players will be able to set up their map, with the
same map viewing security as before.
